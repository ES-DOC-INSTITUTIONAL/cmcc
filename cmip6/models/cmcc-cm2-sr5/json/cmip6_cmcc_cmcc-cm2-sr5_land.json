A full Technical Description of CLM4.5 oleson_2013 is available here: http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.2/clm/CLM45_Tech_Note.pdf.\n\nThe model formalizes and quantifies the land surface and terrestrial ecosystem processes. In particular, CLM4.5 describes the cycling of energy, water, and chemical elements which impact and are impacted by climate. The land surface, indeed, is a critical interface through which climate change impacts humans and ecosystems and through which humans and ecosystems can affect global environmental change.\n\nThe model represents many aspects of the land surface such as surface heterogeneity and consists of components or submodels related to land biogeophysics, the hydrologic cycle, biogeochemistry, human dimensions, and ecosystem dynamics.

                "Spatial land surface heterogeneity in CLM is represented as a nested subgrid hierarchy in which grid cells are composed of multiple land units, snow/soil columns, and Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Each grid cell can have a different number of land units, each land unit can have a different number of columns, and each column can have multiple PFTs. The first subgrid level, the land unit, is intended to capture the broadest spatial patterns of subgrid heterogeneity. CLM4.5 accounts for glacier, lake, urban, and vegetated. The land unit level can be used to further delineate these patterns. For example, the urban land unit is divided into density classes representing the tall building district, high density, and medium density urban areas.  The second subgrid level, the column, is intended to capture potential variability in the soil and snow state variables within a single land unit. For example, the vegetated land unit could contain several columns with independently evolving vertical profiles of soil water and temperature. The central characteristic of the column subgrid level is that this is where the state variables for water and energy in the soil and snow are defined, as well as the fluxes of these components within the soil and snow. Regardless of the number and type of PFTs occupying space on the column, the column physics operates with a single set of upper boundary fluxes, as well as a single set of transpiration fluxes from multiple soil levels. These boundary fluxes are weighted averages over all PFTs. Currently, for glacier, lake and vegetated land units, a single column is assigned to each land unit. The urban land units have five columns (roof, sunlit walls and shaded walls, and pervious and impervious canyon floor). The land/sea mask is defined by the CMCC-CM2 ocean model.  Each land grid cell has one elevation, which is defined by the atmosphere model."

                "The RTM was developed to route total runoff from the land surface model to either the active ocean or marginal seas which enables the hydrologic cycle to be closed. The RTM uses a linear transport scheme to route water from each grid cell to its downstream neighboring grid cell. Downstream water flow direction in each grid cell is determined as one of eight compass points (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest) based on the steepest downhill slope as determined from a digital elevation model graham_1999."
